It\u2019s like Stalker meets el Topo meets Holy Mountain meets Alphaville meets Delicatessen meets Hard to be a God, like Kurosawa, Tarkovsky, and Lynch had a kid together. It was color, possibly Russian, and I don\u2019t really remember the decade but want to say 60s or 70s, though could easily be more recent. It is VERY rare, there is only one crappy partial print of it, and that is what the youtube version is from. Lot of wide shots in a surreal wilderness, winter settings, strange bleeding saturation in some shots. Crazy costumes. Seriously one of the strangest films I\u2019ve ever seen and my favorite films are strange/weird ones.

{"query_id": "802", "query": "Male little person falls in love with red-headed woman .\n I hope someone can help me track down this movie. I may have some details mixed up, or combined with another drama, so if you have any suggestions at all, please share them. There is a Caucasian man, who is a little person, who is successful in his working life but is lonely in his private life. He may be a writer or editor, or some such professional. I think part of the plot is that he might have trouble making friends because some people are prejudiced against his size. Sometimes he abuses alcohol because of this. He re-connects with a woman he knew when he was a child, even though she used to tease him back when they were children. They become friends and eventually fall in love. She is a regular height woman, also Caucasian, slim and with red hair. In the last scene of the movie, they are dancing on a balcony or rooftop and she is wearing a white dress. Maybe it\u2019s their wedding? I have been through the filmographies of all the male Caucasian little people actors I can think of with no luck. My Googlefu has failed me as well.

It was in color, in English, and may have been on one of the kids channels. The main characters are a sister and her younger brother, a family friend who is like a big silent bouncer or bodyguard, and a young suave guy they meet. It\u2019s an adventure-fantasy in some sort of future dystopia. I remember a couple of scenes\u2026 Suave guy sees the sister fight off some military types and invites her to escape with him through a security checkpoint in the desert by racing their flying boards past the guards. They succeed in escaping, and are later joined by the brother and bodyguard dude, much to the chagrin of suave guy, who thought he was ditching the weaker elements. Sister says she would never leave them, they\u2019re her family. Later, the sister gets captured and taken to some sort of facility where she gets strapped to a gurney. She gets out of the straps by shimmying the gurney until the bottom release button is hit, then stretches her legs over her head to hit the top button. She wanders around the facility, running into the brother of a friend that is so doped up he doesn\u2019t even know who he is. She is recaptured, and suave guy and co. break in to save her. The group have almost made it to safety when their way is blocked and bodyguard dude has to sacrifice himself to ensure their escape. The final scene shows the kids running around a beach playing and enjoying their new-found freedom while suave guy does a voiceover.

However, this is just a small piece of a bigger artifact, so this guy is looking for the rest of it. I really do not know why he comes to this particular town, most likely he has info that another piece is located somewhere around the area. Also there are other people looking for the same artifacts and they are in a competition. The movie is pivoting around this search and confrontation between the groups. So it\u2019s mostly an action movie. I remember this scene at the very end of the film, this is how the movie ends. The protagonist and his opponent are fighting on the beach, the hero overcomes his enemy and a wave carries out the pieces of the artifact into the sea. The protagonist is walking sadly along the shore and suddenly finds both pieces thrown ashore by the wave. So he takes these two pieces and moves to some different location continuing his search. The end has this feel of the Incredible Hulk TV series. I remember asking my father about these metallic plates and their meaning.

The creature is taken away, but the man fights for the right for it to be released under some sort of human rights or parental rights \u2013 I believe the main point of the movie was to discuss the rights of a child (or lack of) if it was not technically a human (half human/half alien) \u2013 I think the title of the movie was a word that defined this but I cannot remember it at all.

{"query_id": "330", "query": "Two shy teens cluelessly try to have sex / handjob for the first time (SFW) .\n Film Production Date: Unknown Film is in: Color Setting: Probably pre-Internet Actors: VERY MAYBE Sarah Michelle Gellar and Matthew Broderick, both quite young (teens) I have seen only one scene of this movie (or TV series episode?) that circulated the net as animated GIF with (yellow/white? subtitles), maybe on imgur.com or a similar site. The scene goes like this:  A young girl and a young boy (both 12-16, I\u2019d guess), both half-dressed, seemingly a bit shy and totally clueless about sex, try to have either sex or perform a handjob on the boy. They stand in a simply furnished room with (IIRC) not much more than a bed, a chair and maybe a table.   They alternately make suggestions (more like guesses) how to go about it. When the boy makes a suggestion, he repeatedly refers to horses (\u201clike I\u2019ve seen horses do\u201d, something along those lines).   One of the suggestions is that the girl should stand on a chair.   At one point, the girl tells the boy to stop making references to horses.   At one point, the girl removes her bra (no nudity is shown, thanks to the camera perspective / clipping).   At the end of the scene, the girl is seen having her hands near/in the boy\u2019s genital area and remarking something like \u201coh, only so little (liquid)?\u201d.  The girl had a \u201csmiling dimple\u201d that reminded me of Sarah Michelle Gellar, but I\u2019m absolutely unsure. Even more so with Matthew Broderick. Any help appreciated!"}

{"query_id": "595", "query": "Weird 80\u2019s Beta Max movie .\n Ok. My dad had this movie when I was a kid in the 80\u2019s.  It\u2019s set in the future (like the 2000s)  It\u2019s also really colorful,  live action.  There is this family that I believe lives under ground.  I remember weird food comes through hoses or pipes.  The food is either slimy or colorful and I think the family may be mutated.  I think the name is like the weird something or the freaky something.  But I haven\u2019t seen it since the late 80\u2019s early 90\u2019s."}
{"query_id": "384", "query": "Thriller movie with cult .\n i have seen this movie around a decade or two. It is colored. It is in english language. The plot is: the man (i forgot if it is a priest or a police\u2026 or neither) is investigating a cult slash village because there is something fishy about the town. The kids (might include teenagers) are missing. And it is because they are being collected by the mysterious cult. The nice thing about this movie is that the kids that are being collected should be physically beautiful (dont get me wrong what beautiful means, i just want to remember this movie). They are being collected because satan is coming back to earth beautifully. The scene i remember: the child is riding a horse in her nightgown and or with or without the man who is investigating. I think she was trying to seduce him if he was there with her on the horse. There is another scene that one of them, the child or the man is being dragged by the horse alone. Noone is on top of the horse. But it is sort of controlled by the cult using powers. Some of the kids are found but they are all kind of asleep or their faces are all cut off. The kid is the last one already for the preparation of the coming of satan here on earth to be beautiful. The dialogue i remember was: satan is coming back to earth beautiful. May not be exact. Ending: i think the cult didn\u2019t succeed. You can say it was a happy ending for a thriller/horror movie. Or i could be wrong. Pls help me find the title. Ive been thinking about this for months already. ?"}
{"query_id": "122", "query": "Little white people underground cave .\n I remember a movie I think I saw in the 90s on channel Fox 5.  I think the movie was from the 80s. It was in English and in color.  I remember some humans go into an underground cave.  In the cave these little white creatures that have human face come out.  I think the face color was either green or red.  I think they were like oompa loompas from chocolate factory.  Also I remember at the end there was an unexpected ending.  The main character I think gets shot and killed.  I remember it was on a bus. Please help me find this movie!"}
{"query_id": "828", "query": "Animated Movie (consisted of several short movies) That Was Once On Netflix .\n I remember watching an animated movie in the years 2009-2015. I don\u2019t remember the name or any of the actors of the movie, but I remember a lot about it. First off, it was animated. It wasn\u2019t super high quality, the people/things looked like silhouettes (you couldn\u2019t see their faces or exact clothing details, but you could see the shadows of them). Second, it was about a boy and a girl acting out these \u201cplays\u201d in an old theater owned by an old man, who may have been their grandfather. There was also an owl in the theater, and it looked at the camera and hooted whenever they changed from one \u201cplay\u201d to another. Third, to change from one costume to another, they stood on a sort of platform thing. It \u201cscanned\u201d them, and the silhouettes of the clothes they described appeared on their bodies. The plays/plots I remember are as follows : Boy gets put in prison (wrongly accused of stealing a necklace, I think), but gets pitied by a princess and she takes him food/clothing. However, the good princess\u2019s evil sister tries to marry the boy when he gets out of prison. When he refuses/realizes she\u2019s the evil princess, she curses him to be a wolf. Boy then eventually gets freed by the good princess. Boy finds himself in a city of gold, but an evil dragon rules the city. The dragon gives the people gold, but only if they sacrifice the most beautiful maiden to the dragon every month/year. Boy eventually slays dragon and marries the girl, who was the most beautiful at that time. Boy is in Africa/similar place and likes to play the drum, but is shunned for doing so. The girl\u2019s father is the clan/tribe chief and is dying from illness. Boy gets thrown out of clan/tribe, but saves an old medicine man from a leopard/big cat. Old medicine man teaches boy how to play drum, which ends up healing the sick clan/tribe chief. The drum also makes the clan/tribe unbeatable in battle. Boy is an adventurer in a strange land where he crawls through a tunnel and gets put in prison. He has to choose/marry one of the king\u2019s three daughters, but he doesn\u2019t know which one. A bee flies around the head of the correct daughter because he fed the bee earlier in the tunnel. He also gets help from other monsters he met in the tunnel/cave. There may have been more, but it\u2019s been years since I saw the movie. It was"}
