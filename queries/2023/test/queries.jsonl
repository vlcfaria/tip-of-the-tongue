{"query_id": "519", "query": "redbox mystery driving me insane .\n Ok, so my hubby, brother-in-law, and I rented a movie from redbox in the mid 2000\u2019s (around the time streaming was becoming big) and I gotta say, we were glad we only paid a buck for it. This movie was so bad we talked and joked through the entire thing like the robots out of MST3K. But it bothers me that none of us can remember the name of the movie or what it was about. The only thing any of us really remember was it took place is completely or mostly in a third world country and near the end this woman, American I think, was standing either topless or naked in a bunch of mud and was surrounded by young boys. Most of whom were somewhere around 12-14 years old. And they start covering her in mud and as they do so, they are groping her breasts and ass. Not sure if they were supposed to, but they were. I think this scene stuck with us because it was about the best part of the movie and the only thing even relatively exciting that happened. We kept watching hoping that it would get better at some point. That someone didn\u2019t actually, from start to finish, make a movie that terrible. I hope someone can help, because I would really like that know what that movie was supposed to be about and what it was called. I thank you all in advance."}

The movie was in English and it was in color. I would say the movie is probably from somewhere in the early-to-mid 80\u2019s. A boy walks into a room and notices someone sleeping (or dead) and takes an item from them and walks out. He\u2019s shown to be the stereotypical nerd with glasses and a tucked in, button up shirt. There were scenes of him putting on headphones and tinkering around with what seemed to be a giant computer or radio system. In one class, a bully teases him and he makes a mixture in a beaker and pours it on the bully\u2019s arm. Turns out it was acid. Later on at home, the parents are going out and hire an older woman to babysit him and his sister. One scene has the woman pouring milk for her kitten and puts a box over it as its drinking, but later when she lifts up the box, the kitten is gone. I think the boy appears holding and petting it before her. The boy is shown in either the front yard or backyard, setting up a light sensor system. The bully shows up later, now with a bandaged hand and crosses the sensor, alerting the boy. I think they end up in the garage when the boy shows up with a sword and spiked helmet. A piece of wood or cardboard falls when they scuffle and the bully tries to push it forward but the boy stabs the sword through, killing the bully. Don\u2019t remember how it starts, but the boy and the babysitter fights and he ends up throwing her kitten into the fire. When she\u2019s crying over it, he knocks her out (i think). As she\u2019s on the ground, he gloats and pours alcohol/wine on her face/head. She gets up and I think they fight a bit more and she pushes him. He falls on top of the spiked helmet from earlier and crawls away. The parents come home and she doesn\u2019t respond to them and gets her bike to leave, all the while they\u2019re yelling that she drank all the alcohol. A closeup of the boy\u2019s face is seen staring off into space and we realize he is dead. A hand reaches for his glasses and we see the little sister putting them on.

I think in that movie, there were strange crawling creatures, that looked like trilobites or giant isopods. They came from a strange aparatus which could have been a time machine, portal to another dimension or something like that. In one scene you could see a monster in this machine, that looked somewhat like the creature from \u201cnightbeast\u201d. One other scene, I remeber was that sombody takes off his shirt and the chest is full of moving segments like his body is mutating into one of these isopod like creatures. And in another scene, a woman awakens in a sickroom and touches the roses that have been given to her from visitors and these roses shrivel and wither like they have been put into liquid nitrogen and freeze dried. I think it was this woman, who turned the mans penis into the giant carnivorous worm creature and mabe she was like that because she was attacked by one of the strange isopods. But my memories are very blurred, I cant even remember a single dialogue. But I can remeber, that the penis scene frightened me to death and after that, I stoped watching. I saw this movie long time ago. When I was a child, my parents used to buy old VHS cassets from garage sales. Normaly we used them to record TV films, but some of them contained watchable movies. One of them had this strange film on it and was so frightening to me back then. It has been around 1995 to 1998, that I watched it, but the record must have been older. My memories are blurred, I think it was in german language, but probably just a translation. I would guess it was some kind of an american 80\u2019s science fiction horror B-Movie. The Movie was definitely in color and looked like rather low budget, but heavily loaded with absurd body horror and strange mutations. The scenes I remember are scattered and probably twisted, because so much time passed since than and I never saw this movie again. I hope, I dont mix two films together. But I can clearly say, that it is not \u201cTromeo and Juliet\u201d, which is the only other movie with a \u201cpenis monster\u201d, that I know. My parents dont remember the title either, but they recall the movie to be over the top and gruesome and I doubt they will find the original VHS record any time soon. Maybe they have been so disgusted, that they deleted it. I would be very happy if anyone could help me with this film, because I could not manage to find the movie with the help of Google or IMDB, although I searched for days."}

{"query_id": "984", "query": "Strange movie on IFC .\n Hi. I am looking for the name of this strange movie I watched years ago. (probably 2006-2010) The movie was in English, on IFC and in Color. The plot was very weird but from what I can remember it started with a Fat girl/lady who hated her life. She at one point runs away and lies on a rock. A guy in a truck stops and has sex with her. From that point she is pregnant and soon gives birth to her daughter named Candy/Candi. The movie continues to show that the lady is miserable and wants to be a icon or famous or a model. Eventually her next door neighbors or some people she knows use her for murders and crimes and make it seem like they are agents and she is doing art or \u201cpreforming\u201d. Eventually I think Candy/Candi is killed off by her mom. The neighbor people go on trial to convict the main character of her crimes, the main character is killed off by the electric chair. I know this is rather vague but I hope this is enough information. This is all I can remember. Thanks for any help."}

I can remember a scene where this blonde guy was in a brothel and he drew this woman, who predicted something about his future (she had a black knife and I think she might have been a witch or something?).. Later he met with some aristocrats and fell in love with a girl there\u2026. so they were kind of constantly flirting and going back and forth throughout the movie.

The movie was a British or Irish comedy that had come out sometime in the mid to late 1990s.  It was about a meek librarian who lived with a domineering mother, had  a bitch of a sister with a thuggish boyfriend and a lover she had to hide from her family.  She was fascinated by great serial killers of the past and eventually several famous ones start appearing to her.  They help guide her in first killing her mother, then her sister and then the sister\u2019s boyfriend.  She ends marrying her lover and sending her \u201cadvisors\u201d away because \u2013 as she points out \u2013 they were all caught and she doen\u2019t want to be. There are two scenes that I particular remember.  The first is after she kills her sister, which she does by doing something to her inhaler.  The sister\u2019s boyfriend decides that she killed her because she wanted him.  They are standing in the kitchen together and he tells her that she can have him if she wants him that badly.  I remember her smiling at him and putting her arms around him before stabbing him in the back with a pair of scissors. The second is the last sense.  She\u2019s on her honeymoon with the man she\u2019s been in love with the entire time and they are lying in bed together.  He has his eyes closed, getting ready to go to sleep and he says that btw he knows she killed her mother.  Something she said at the time didn\u2019t add up but that he understands why she did it and would never tell anyone.  She gets up out of bed after he\u2019s asleep and is trying to figure out to what to do.  She opens the door and there\u2019s a little man in a Victorian suit with a kind of doctor\u2019s bag there who smiles at her and introduces himself very politely as Jack the Ripper.

I think one the main people was crippled or walking with the aid of a stick. I can\u2019t excactly remember the details of the story but I remember some specific scenes. One in particular where a person (I think a woman, one of the main characters in the movie) is in a car on a bridge. And these strange ripples appear making the bridge disappear bit by bit and causing her to fall into the water. And then a few second later the bridge reappears again piece by piece. Then there is a scene where the main protagonists get together and find out where those ripples come from and apparently they come from somewhere in the middle of an ocean or sea. They try to go their on a boat before it is too late (they have limited time from what I can remember, before the next ripple comes) and then they arrive at this sort of facility in the middle of the sea and they go inside and find out tue government or military (I\u2019m not sure) is creating the ripples and the boss there explains everything. I\u2019m not sure what happens next but in the end they all are back at home and their lives are better.

They both have fake passports/identities and they are dressed in character. There characters are very different \u2013 while perhaps incorrect, I am picturing Bernie Mac in traditional South African attire and Eddie Jemison as a Rabbi or something. They both get to the front of their security lines and realise they have switched passports so Bernie Mac has to pretend to be a rabbi in his South African attire and Eddie Jemison takes off his yamaka and pretends to be South African. The security agent with Eddie happens to speak the South African language and the crew of con artists get really nervous as they watch Eddie wondering how he\u2019s going to convince the security agent. After a pause, Eddie responds perfectly in the South African language and suprises everyone. They both make it through the security line safely.   Again, I may have the actors and fake identities wrong, but the the concept is definitely correct, and hopefully some of my memory is correct and will spark something in one of your minds!

I mostly recall the beginning because it really caught me off guard. A woman (I believe the one the movie is about) was giving birth, and they actually showed the baby coming out. It wasn\u2019t fake at all, I\u2019m pretty sure it was an actual birth. They cut it together with the actresses face and it looked like she was really giving birth. Maybe that\u2019s too progressive for the 70\u2019s? I\u2019m not sure\u2026I saw the film in the early 2000\u2019s at some point, so maybe it was never an just looked old? I\u2019m not sure\u2026hoping someone knows what I\u2019m talking about."}

The men have been extinct due to their violent ways for many centuries. Then a scientist creates a man in her laboratory and he soon is discovered.   What\u2019s the name of this movie?"}
{"query_id": "263", "query": "SnowWhite/RoseRed-esque, circa 1960\u2019s .\n SnowWhite/RoseRed-esque, circa 1960\u2019s a cabin in the snow, two girls, possibly sisters, one who rides this strange/wierd wooden \u201cpig-shaped\u201d sled\u2026.maybe of German descent\u2026.the girl has really rosy red cheeks and is kind of the version of an \u201cugly step sister\u201d\u2026.I am sure I saw this when I was a little girl, it freaked me out but it was intriguing at the same time. Does this strike anyone\u2019s memory?"}
{"query_id": "709", "query": "Fantasy movie, kidnapped baby .\n I saw this movie in the late 80\u2019s, or maybe even the early 90\u2019s\u2026I think I saw it on HBO, but it could have been VHS \u2013 I was at a friend\u2019s house and I was pretty young so I can\u2019t completely remember. This wizard guy steals a baby and his mother has to go find him and get him back through some crazy fantasy land. If she doesn\u2019t get him back by a certain time, the baby has to stay there forever\u2026.the woman keeps getting tricked by the wizard but she eventually outsmarts him and gets her baby back. It was kind of strange, and I\u2019ve never heard of it afterwards so it might have been low budget or something."}
{"query_id": "565", "query": "70s film .\n Judging by the quality, I\u2019d say this film was made in the 70s. It\u2019s about a large American family who all come back home to attend the funeral of the youngest member, a guy who killed himself. After the funeral, which happens early in the film, they all go home, and from there it\u2019s basically one of those films where everyone\u2019s thinking about their life choices, etc. There\u2019s a bit of tension because they\u2019ve all got their own lives and live in different states so they don\u2019t see each other a lot."}
